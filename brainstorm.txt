Basic premise:
You are a cat owner trying to go about your life and do your job
from home. The cat will frequently get hungry or want a treat, and
you must satisfy the cat or it will (run away/bring mice in - not
sure yet). If you don't do your minimum tasks though, you get demoted
or fired.

Tasks:
Short simple tasks that you must do, for example
- Writing code:
  - You must press C/V in the correct order some number of times to
    write the code
  - If you type a wrong character, you must press backspace and type
    it again
  - Hungry cats can type characters or press backspace
- Attending a meeting:
  - You must press A/B/C in the right order when a person asks you a
    question
  - Cat interruption will add extra characters that you must press
    (ie apologising for/explaining cat)
  - 
  
- Time passes faster while doing a task

Cats:
- Start off with 1, buy more as you get promoted and have more money
- Cat gets hungry over the course of the day
  - This makes them get more annoying
  - They come to you when their hunger passes a threshold
  - They'll interrupt you if they are hungry
  - You mustn't overfeed your cat
- Giving the cat treats can prolong their hunger without making them
  sick/overfeeding them
- Cat needs litter cleaning as well

- Cat gets sick and must go to vet (LEAVE THIS FOR LAST)
